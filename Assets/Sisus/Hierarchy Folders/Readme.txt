### Hierarchy Folders
A hierarchy folder is an editor-only GameObject meant to help in organizing the GameObjects in your scenes.

### Quick Start Guide
You can organize your hierarchy by grouping GameObjects under hierarchy folders.

Use the menu item "*GameObject > Hierarchy Folder*" to add new hierarchy folders to the active scene.

If you select two or more GameObjects in the Hierarchy window and then use this menu item, the selected GameObjects will be placed under the newly created hierarchy folder.

You can also nest hierarchy folders under other hierarchy folders.

Hierarchy folders are stripped from builds, to avoid any negative effects on performance.

### Configuration
You can configure various aspects of the package in the preferences.
To open the preferences view select the menu item "Edit > Preferences..." and select the Hierarchy Folders tab.

### Support
You can contact support using the email support@sisus.co.
